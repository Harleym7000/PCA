        benefit of the community.</p>

        <h1>History of the Red Sails Festival</h1>
        <p>Although the first Red Sails Festival was in the year 2000, The P.C.A. first started organising summer festivals in 
           the early 1970’s. Known simply as the Portstewart Summer Carnival, they were originally held in June. 
           The aim was to raise money, to provide a Summer break in the seaside town of Portstewart for children living in 
           areas of Northern Ireland experiencing the worst effects of the “ Troubles”.</p>
                
        <p>Later the carnival moved to late July and any money raised, was distributed to local charities. The main source of 
           income was from stall holders and an annual raffle. Over the years many members of the community played a part in 
           maintaining this popular annual event. However, by the year 2000, the P.C.A. committee consisted of a largely 
           ageing membership, who decided that a recruitment drive for volunteers was needed and that without new 
           volunteers they could no longer be able to organize the Summer Carnival.</p>
                
           Fortunately, the recruitment drive worked. Several new volunteers helped to form a carnival committee for that year.
           That committee came up with the idea of re-branding the carnival with an attractive title with links to Portstewart.
           The committee decided on the title of The Red Sails Festival-in honour of Jimmy Kennedy, one of the greatest 
           songwriters of the twentieth century. Jimmy, whose parents had a  home in Portstewart, had a huge worldwide hit in 
           1936 with “Red Sails In The Sunset”. The song was inspired by the beautiful scenery and sunsets in Portstewart. 
           Not only was the song a hit in that year, but has gone to be covered by many artists ever since. 
           The song Red Sails was inspired by a painting done by my his sister of a boat coming into the harbour with the sun 
           catching the sail ( Source: Jimmy's grand daughter).</p>
                
           <p>Jimmy wrote over 2000 songs-many of them hits, including The Teddy Bears Picnic, South of the Border and My 
              Prayer Until Lennon and McCartney he had more hits in America than other British or Irish songwriter.The year 
              2000 also saw the introduction of the first festival programme brochure. Local business advertising in the 
              program became an additional source of revenue for the festival.</p>
                
           <p>The first Red Sails Festival consisted of around eighteen events organized by the committee. The programme also 
                   listed approximately 20 to 25 other events that were happening in the area that week. Over the next 
                   sixteen years the Red Sails Festival has grown to become one of the most popular events in the North West, 
                   with an annual programme of over seventy events.</p>
                
           <p>A couple of years after its inception the Festival changed from an event that raised money for various charities 
              to a non- profit making event. The primary aim became to provide a festival that comprised of a variety of mainly
              free events for all ages-making the festival accessible for all. Although the P.C.A. does not raise money directly 
              for charities during the week-many charities have raised £1000's by organising street collections during the 
              festival week.</p>
                
          <p>In 2005 The P.C.A. first applied for external funding. On this occasion from the Big Lottery. Every year since 
                  then The P.C.A. has applied for grant funding from various sources. Successful application to The Council 
                  delivered Community Festival Fund (supported by D.C.A.L./Department for Communities) has also had a very 
                  important impact in the growth of the festival. The PCA has also been successful on the two other occasions 
                  it applied for grants from the BIg Lottery, including this year, 2017.</p>
                
          <p>Over the years other groups/ organisations have come part of the festival experience by organizing events to 
                  coincide with the festival and become part of the programme-i.e. Big Telly and Portstewart Library</p>
